README 

[1.1] 
Setup chosen visual framework, using Bootstrap
Setup base file structure (MVC), using AngularJS
Setup API proof of concept for Behance API - just a description of the Spark app, and some JSON data that was returned from a query
Setup database for Spark app users
Setup database 'users' table structure - still need password security


[1.2]
Previously included some responsiveness to visual framework - will need adjustment
Designed style tile for Spark app (Signup, Listing and Details - uniform style)
Started implementing style guide - will improve as more content is added

[2.1]
Resubmitted files with views for MVC format. Still woking on the AngularJS views, so for now I have included php views

[2.2]
Added more API functionality and more responsive styling

[3.1]
Included index.php with the login view. 
Currently having login issues - I invested most of my time trying to figure out angularjs with firebase for data storage
To get an idea of the profile view (read view), see index.html
Still working on CRUD functionality - having trouble setting up firebase db
Most recent sql dump = assets/sql/mdd1310_2013-10-16.sql
Implemented password salting 

[4.1]
Now using the AngularJS MV* framework properly (controller = mainController.js, views = partials/, services.js communicates with db)
Now using Firebase for online data storage and user auth (php files have been removed)
Create a new account or Login using my account (email: katie4@test.com, pw: pass123)
Feed displays recently posted project list
- Sometimes when returning to Feed view, validation text says user is logged out, but usually corrects itself after a few seconds
- Pagination at bottom of feed page is not working. Each Behance API request only returns 12 objects at a time, but you get the idea on the first page
- "View Details" should display a project detail (project-detail.html), but controller logic is not correct
- Clicking the project title will take you to the Behance project detail view
Update view lets user modify account info or change password
Profile view displays the updated account info
Help dropdown includes Report a problem, Terms and policies, Help and faq
Logout ends session and returns user to login page
